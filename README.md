# Rogue Survivor

Rogue Survivor is a third-person shooter demo with gameplay similar to Vampire Survivors. 

There are three difficulties - each corresponding to how long the game timer runs for. The choices are: 10, 15, or 30 minutes.

The player spawns in with a semi-automatic crossbow. The goal of the game is to survive until the timer runs out.

The player can collect experience from defeated enemies to unlock powerful upgrades.
